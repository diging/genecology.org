A Place can \nbe determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It \nmay be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation. \n It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or \nabsolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context \nof cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in \nposition in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which \nNelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object \u2013 H.M.S Victory. A resolution of \nthis Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the \nvessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack \nhistorical and cultural relevance. \nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees \nthe notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. \nExamples:   \n\u0083 the extent of the UK in the year 2003 \n\u0083 the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring \n\u0083 the place referred to in the phrase: \u201cFish collected at three miles north of the confluence of \nthe Arve and the Rhone\u201d \n\u0083 here -> <-  ",

An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation. \nSince our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely.  An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known. \n\tAutomatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.\n",

In a sense, the respective instance of E91 Co-Reference Assignment using the property P155 has co-reference target (is co-reference target of) in a knowledge base forms propositional object referring to the creator\u2019s target entity, since a knowledge base as a whole can be seen as a propositional object. Consequently, if in a Semantic Web implementation the target entity is instantiated by a URI, the meaning of this identifier must be unambiguous to the creator of the co-reference assignment. Similarly, a URI of another authority, such as an author catalogue of a library, can be interpreted as a referring proposition of this catalogue, and be referred to by the property P153 assigned co-reference to (was regarded to co-refer by) or P154 assigned non co-reference to (was regarded not to co-refer by): E89 Propositional Object in order to express that it does not immediately represent the creator\u2019s known world. In this case, the authority that knows the meaning of this URI must be unambiguous by the form of the URI itself.\nIn contrast, the meaning of the property \u2018owl:same_as\u2019 of the OWL knowledge representation language cannot specify who\u2019s knowledge it represents and cannot express kind of confidence. Therefore it is not adequate to model the progress of scholarly co-reference research.\n",

        "comment": "This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period, the open spaces via which they have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event, such as the air in a meeting room transferring the voices. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas. In these cases, the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are not regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent. Consequently, instances of E4 Period may occupy each a limited number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes.\n\nTypically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the \u201cNeolithic Period\u201d, the \u201cMing Dynasty\u201d or the \u201cMcCarthy Era\u201d, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. Geopolitical units may be distributed over disconnected areas, such as islands or colonies. In such cases, the spatiotemporal extent is composed of more than one spacetime volume. One may argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units. Nevertheless, an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. I.e., if it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole, but it may involve one area after another, such as the Polynesian migration, as long as it is ongoing at least in one area.\n\nThere are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of \u2018artistic style\u2019, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, \u201cImpressionism\u201d can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n",

However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object \u2013 H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.

In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.\nFor instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \nThis property is a shortcut of the fully developed path from \u2018E18 Physical Thing\u2019 through \u2018P157 occupied\u2019, \u2018E92 Spacetime Volume\u2019, \u2018P159 has spatial projection\u2019 to \u2018E53 Place\u2019. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully developed path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.\nIn contrast to P156  occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.  Further it does not constrain this reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.\n\t",

E. T. Jones was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the WPBS to NIAB. For members of the SPBS, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, David Harberd, ecalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, Muriel, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached Gregor and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  \\r\\n\\r\\n> Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in\\r\\n *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\\r\\n \\r\\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of\\r\\n*Drosophila melanogaster*,\\r\\n\\r\\n> Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\\r\\n\\r\\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August.

Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in\\n <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of\\n<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\\n</blockquote>\", \"about\": [], \"tags\": [5]}}]",

In my dissertation, that through-thread was Bradshaw and his intellectual trajectory: from his training at Cambridge and Aberystwyth, through the early development of his research program at Bangor and Liverpool. Following a field through time, however, is a much less straightforward task. What can appear from afar to be a coherent and well-defined system of people and research questions can quickly become murky and mercurial upon closer inspection. At the edges, the research aims and participants of a scientific field are constantly intermingling with those of other fields. Thus historians usually opt for easier targets: people, institutions, and sometimes scientific journals. Following these objects through time and space is indeed valuable, and a large part of the Genecology Project has been documenting the people, places, and productions of genecology and ecological genetics. But these paths are only tangential to the broader arc of history that we are attempting to follow: the growth and development of a scientific field. Some of those paths (Bradshaw's, for instance) track more closely to that arc than others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortuitously, when it comes to the story of ecological genetics we have an even more substantial thread to follow: a community of scientists called the **Ecological Genetics Group (the EGG)**. The EGG is the longest-running professional meeting for ecological geneticists in Britain, and will [convene for the 60th time](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/events/egg2016/) in Aberystwyth, this spring. The connection between ecological genetics and the EGG goes far deeper than its name. It was Bradshaw and his colleagues in Wales and Scotland\\u2014the genecologists\\u2014whose informal meetings at Aberystwyth, Bangor, and Edinburgh in the mid-1950s gave rise to the EGG. It was through the students, colleagues, and acquaintances of that small nucleus of genecologists that the EGG expanded in subsequent decades. And, as the announcement for the 60th meeting makes clear, the EGG continues to consider Aberystwyth its \\\"home\\\". Thanks to the diligent work of EGG secretary [John Warren](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/staff/jhw/), the programs and attendance lists for almost every meeting has been deposited at the National Library of Wales. As through-threads go, this collections of names, institutions, and frequently titles and/or abstracts of presentations and discussion topics, provides a remarkable trail to follow from the middle of the 1950s up through 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Project\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next several months, I will be tracing the EGG from its earliest meetings in the 1950s up through its 60th meeting in 2016. Unlike typical historical research projects, I won't be shutting myself up in a library for five years before emerging with an embossed door-stop: this project will take place out in the open\\u2014\\\"in the wild\\\"\\u2013on this website. I will begin with several posts from the final chapter of my dissertation, \\\"Hatching the EGG,\\\" adapted for online bite-sized consumption. I will then begin to reconstruct the investigative pathways of EGG participants, the individual threads of the EGG's development. As I attempt to understand the research questions and problems that characterized ecological genetics over this sixty-year period, I will also pay close attention to the institutional and geographic contexts in which that research took place, and the organisms that ecological geneticists studied. Rather than ruminate on this work in hope of producing a fully-formed synthesis, I will be posting my notes and reflections here as the project unfolds. Meanwhile, I'll be making available a variety of materials from my dissertation research, including recordings and transcripts of oral history interviews, photographs, and other \\\"digital surrogates\\\" that shed light on the history of ecological genetics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, I'll be making available a very rich dataset produced by researchers in the [Digital Innovation Group](http://diging.asu.edu) at Arizona State University that documents collaborative ties among genecologists in Britain around the middle of the 20th century. This dataset is interesting in terms of both its content and the methods used to create it. First and foremost, it provides time-variant social network data that can be used to ask quantitative questions about the evolution of the field. Rather than source these network data from bibliographic metadata (essentially, using co-authorship to model social networks), as is common in science-studies, this dataset was generated by annotating the acknowledgment sections of research articles using the [Vogon](http://www.vogonweb.net) text annotation platform. More on this soon!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Open-notebook research\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is an example of open notebook research, a practice [championed by chemist Jean-Claude Bradley](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/39/version/1). In future posts I'll elaborate on why I chose this approach, and what kinds of outcomes I hope to achieve beyond creating new knowledge about the history of ecological genetics. For now, I'll share [Bradley's own description](http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html) of \\\"Open Notebook Science\\\": \\r\\n\\r\\n> By this I mean that there is a URL to a laboratory notebook (like this) that is freely available and indexed on common search engines. It does not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world. Basically, no insider information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore soon on what that can mean for the history of science.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Source code\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source code for this site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/erickpeirson/genecology.org).

Unlike typical historical research projects, I won't be shutting myself up in a library for five years before emerging with an embossed door-stop: this project will take place out in the open\\u2014\\\"in the wild\\\"\\u2013on this website. I will begin with several posts from the final chapter of my dissertation, \\\"Hatching the EGG,\\\" adapted for online bite-sized consumption. I will then begin to reconstruct the investigative pathways of EGG participants, the individual threads of the EGG's development. As I attempt to understand the research questions and problems that characterized ecological genetics over this sixty-year period, I will also pay close attention to the institutional and geographic contexts in which that research took place, and the organisms that ecological geneticists studied. Rather than ruminate on this work in hope of producing a fully-formed synthesis, I will be posting my notes and reflections here as the project unfolds.

This dataset is interesting in terms of both its content and the methods used to create it.

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.2 Conception\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) was to be held in July, 1956. E. T. Jones was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the WPBS to NIAB. For members of the SPBS, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, David Harberd, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, Muriel, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached Gregor and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  \\r\\n\\r\\n> Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\\r\\n \\r\\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of *Drosophila melanogaster*,\\r\\n\\r\\n> Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\\r\\n\\r\\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)\\r\\n\\r\\nA third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\r\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\n> We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\r\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\r\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.3. Incorporation\\r\\nThomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\r\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of *Euphorbia cyparissias* (cypress spurge) and *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting.

Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled *The conservation of ecological races*, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s work on *Agrostis* at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries.

They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.4. Diversification\\r\\nWhereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic *Trifolium* was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. \\r\\n\\r\\nJones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\r\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of *Viola*, and later *Primula*. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.5. Conclusion\\r\\nOne of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.\", \"summary_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"body_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"_summary_rendered\": \"<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) ...</p>\", \"published\": true, \"_body_rendered\": \"<p>The following account of the formation of the Ecological Genetics Group is taken from chapter 4 of <a href=\\\"https://www.academia.edu/12338967/Evolution_Under_Our_Feet_Anthony_David_Bradshaw_1926_2008_and_the_Rise_of_Ecological_Genetics\\\">my dissertation</a>. It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.</p>\\n<h2>4.2 Conception</h2>\\n<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) was to be held in July, 1956. E. T. Jones was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the WPBS to NIAB. For members of the SPBS, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, David Harberd, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  </p>\\n<p>As the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, Muriel, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached Gregor and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. </p>\\n<p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.</p>\\n<h2>4.3. Incorporation</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of <em>Euphorbia cyparissias</em> (cypress spurge) and <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.</p>\\n<p>In his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations.

Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.</p>\\n<p>From Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)</p>\\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation.

Corner from Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>The earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic <em>Trifolium</em> was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. </p>\\n<p>Jones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.</p>\\n<p>The EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.</p>\\n<p>Interest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of <em>Viola</em>, and later <em>Primula</em>. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.</p>\\n<p>Since 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.</p>\\n<h2>4.5. Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>One of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.</p>\\n<p>The brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.</p>\", \"about\": [1, 9, 11, 13], \"tags\": [5]}}]",

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.2 Conception\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) was to be held in July, 1956. E. T. Jones was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the WPBS to NIAB. For members of the SPBS, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, David Harberd, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, Muriel, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached Gregor and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  \\r\\n\\r\\n> Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\\r\\n \\r\\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of *Drosophila melanogaster*,\\r\\n\\r\\n> Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\\r\\n\\r\\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)\\r\\n\\r\\nA third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\r\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\n> We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\r\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\r\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.3. Incorporation\\r\\nThomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\r\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of *Euphorbia cyparissias* (cypress spurge) and *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nGregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. \\r\\n\\r\\n> I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled *The conservation of ecological races*, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s work on *Agrostis* at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\\r\\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme *Agrostis stolonifera* x *A. tenuis* hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\\r\\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. \\r\\n\\r\\n> A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: \\r\\n\\r\\n> It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\r\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.4. Diversification\\r\\nWhereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic *Trifolium* was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. \\r\\n\\r\\nJones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\r\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of *Viola*, and later *Primula*. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society.

Conclusion\\r\\nOne of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956.

Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.\", \"summary_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"body_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"_summary_rendered\": \"<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth.

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.</p>\\n<h2>4.2 Conception</h2>\\n<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) was to be held in July, 1956. E. T. Jones was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the WPBS to NIAB. For members of the SPBS, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, David Harberd, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  </p>\\n<p>As the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, Muriel, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached Gregor and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. </p>\\n<p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to Keith Jones,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, Dennis Wilkins, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of Bradshaw\\u2019s 1952 discovery at Goginan mine. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.</p>\\n<h2>4.3. Incorporation</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of <em>Euphorbia cyparissias</em> (cypress spurge) and <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.</p>\\n<p>In his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.</p>\\n<p>From Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)</p>\\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled <em>The conservation of ecological races</em>, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s work on <em>Agrostis</em> at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme <em>Agrostis stolonifera</em> x <em>A. tenuis</em> hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Finally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).</p>\\n<h2>4.4. Diversification</h2>\\n<p>Whereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>The earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic <em>Trifolium</em> was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. </p>\\n<p>Jones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.</p>\\n<p>The EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.</p>\\n<p>Interest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of <em>Viola</em>, and later <em>Primula</em>. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.</p>\\n<p>Since 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.</p>\\n<h2>4.5.

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.2 Conception\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the [National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)](/concepts/10/) was to be held in July, 1956. [E. T. Jones](/concepts/people/8/) was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the [WPBS](/concepts/11/) to NIAB. For members of the [SPBS](/concepts/12/), the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, [David Harberd](/concepts/people/9/), recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, [Muriel](/concepts/people/13/), had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached [Gregor](/concepts/people/6/) and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  \\r\\n\\r\\n> Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to [Keith Jones](/concepts/people/14/),  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, [Dennis Wilkins](/people/16/), had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of [Bradshaw\\u2019s](/concepts/people/1/) 1952 discovery at [Goginan mine](/concepts/15/). Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\\r\\n \\r\\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of *Drosophila melanogaster*,\\r\\n\\r\\n> Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\\r\\n\\r\\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)\\r\\n\\r\\nA third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\r\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\n> We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\r\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\r\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.3. Incorporation\\r\\nThomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\r\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of *Euphorbia cyparissias* (cypress spurge) and *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nGregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. \\r\\n\\r\\n> I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled *The conservation of ecological races*, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s work on *Agrostis* at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\\r\\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme *Agrostis stolonifera* x *A. tenuis* hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\\r\\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. \\r\\n\\r\\n> A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: \\r\\n\\r\\n> It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\r\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.4. Diversification\\r\\nWhereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic *Trifolium* was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. \\r\\n\\r\\nJones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\r\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of *Viola*, and later *Primula*. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.5. Conclusion\\r\\nOne of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.\", \"summary_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"body_markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"_summary_rendered\": \"<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth.

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.</p>\\n<h2>4.2 Conception</h2>\\n<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the <a href=\\\"/concepts/10/\\\">National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)</a> was to be held in July, 1956. <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/8/\\\">E. T. Jones</a> was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the <a href=\\\"/concepts/11/\\\">WPBS</a> to NIAB. For members of the <a href=\\\"/concepts/12/\\\">SPBS</a>, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/9/\\\">David Harberd</a>, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  </p>\\n<p>As the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/13/\\\">Muriel</a>, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/6/\\\">Gregor</a> and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. </p>\\n<p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/14/\\\">Keith Jones</a>,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, <a href=\\\"/people/16/\\\">Dennis Wilkins</a>, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/1/\\\">Bradshaw\\u2019s</a> 1952 discovery at <a href=\\\"/concepts/15/\\\">Goginan mine</a>. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.</p>\\n<h2>4.3. Incorporation</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of <em>Euphorbia cyparissias</em> (cypress spurge) and <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.</p>\\n<p>In his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.</p>\\n<p>From Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)</p>\\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled <em>The conservation of ecological races</em>, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s work on <em>Agrostis</em> at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme <em>Agrostis stolonifera</em> x <em>A. tenuis</em> hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Finally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).</p>\\n<h2>4.4. Diversification</h2>\\n<p>Whereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>The earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic <em>Trifolium</em> was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. </p>\\n<p>Jones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.</p>\\n<p>The EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.</p>\\n<p>Interest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of <em>Viola</em>, and later <em>Primula</em>. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.</p>\\n<p>Since 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.</p>\\n<h2>4.5. Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>One of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.</p>\\n<p>The brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.</p>\", \"about\": [16, 1, 17, 9, 11, 13, 15, 21, 20, 19, 22, 23, 25], \"tags\": [5]}}]",

E. A Lewis was likely the historian at Aberystwyth. Herbert Jones was at botanist at Aberystwyth.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Surveys of the plants growing on the old workings and dumps at Goginan made by E. A. Lewis & Herbert Jones (unpublished) demonstrated the paucity of species and individuals. Thlaspi alpestre was absent, though it occurred in the Ystwyth valley in polluted areas and was a conspicuous feature of the colonized old workings of the Mendip Hills.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Hooper & Newton (1935) and Hooper (1937) showed that lead had only a very slight toxic effect on dwarf French beans grown in single salt cultures with lead sulphate, or in the presence of nutrient salts and lead sulphate. This was true even when a saturated solution of lead sulphate was used, containing 30 p.p.m. lead. Spraying experiments indicated that the presence of lead on Ulex, Lupinus or Carter's '50 days' dwarf French bean plants had no deleterious effects.

If the soil method were adopted colonization by vegetation would be possible, and the removal, at all events in part, of the unsightly character of the old mines would be effected.</p>\\n</blockquote>\", \"about\": [27, 29, 23], \"tags\": []}}]",

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.2 Conception\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the [National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)](/concepts/10/) was to be held in July, 1956. [E. T. Jones](/concepts/people/8/) was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the [WPBS](/concepts/11/) to NIAB. For members of the [SPBS](/concepts/12/), the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, [David Harberd](/concepts/people/9/), recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, [Muriel](/concepts/people/13/), had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached [Gregor](/concepts/people/6/) and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  \\r\\n\\r\\n> Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to [Keith Jones](/concepts/people/14/),  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, [Dennis Wilkins](/people/16/), had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of [Bradshaw\\u2019s](/concepts/people/1/) 1952 discovery at [Goginan mine](/concepts/15/). Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\\r\\n \\r\\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of *Drosophila melanogaster*,\\r\\n\\r\\n> Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\\r\\n\\r\\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)\\r\\n\\r\\nA third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\r\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\n> We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). \\r\\n\\r\\nGregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\r\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\r\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.3. Incorporation\\r\\nThomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\r\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \\u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of *Euphorbia cyparissias* (cypress spurge) and *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John\\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \\u201cthe country\\u2019s gene pools.\\u201d He wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nGregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. \\r\\n\\r\\n> I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled *The conservation of ecological races*, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s work on *Agrostis* at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\n> As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \\u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\\r\\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme *Agrostis stolonifera* x *A. tenuis* hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\\r\\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. \\r\\n\\r\\n> A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: \\r\\n\\r\\n> It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\r\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.4. Diversification\\r\\nWhereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic *Trifolium* was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. \\r\\n\\r\\nJones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\r\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of *Viola*, and later *Primula*. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.5. Conclusion\\r\\nOne of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.\", \"_summary_rendered\": \"<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth.

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.</p>\\n<h2>4.2 Conception</h2>\\n<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the <a href=\\\"/concepts/10/\\\">National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)</a> was to be held in July, 1956. <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/8/\\\">E. T. Jones</a> was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \\u201cPowys\\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the <a href=\\\"/concepts/11/\\\">WPBS</a> to NIAB. For members of the <a href=\\\"/concepts/12/\\\">SPBS</a>, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \\u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/9/\\\">David Harberd</a>, recalled, \\u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  </p>\\n<p>As the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\\u2019s wife, <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/13/\\\">Muriel</a>, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/6/\\\">Gregor</a> and asked to be excused from the meeting. \\u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\\u201d Harberd explained, \\u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. </p>\\n<p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \\u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\\u201d Gregor asked. \\u201cOf course I want to go,\\u201d Harberd replied, \\u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \\u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\\u2019s idea to <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/14/\\\">Keith Jones</a>,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, <a href=\\\"/people/16/\\\">Dennis Wilkins</a>, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of <a href=\\\"/concepts/people/1/\\\">Bradshaw\\u2019s</a> 1952 discovery at <a href=\\\"/concepts/15/\\\">Goginan mine</a>. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\\u201d , \\u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \\u201cOregon\\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Gregor also described the meeting as \\u201cinformal\\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\\u2019s\\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.</p>\\n<h2>4.3. Incorporation</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \\u201cenvironmental education\\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984).

Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.</p>\\n<p>From Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)</p>\\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \\u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled <em>The conservation of ecological races</em>, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy.

Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The group seemed to agree that \\u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \\u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\\u201d as well as to provide \\u201cuseful sources of genes\\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Finally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \\u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \\u201cGenecology Group\\u201d was rejected, and \\u201cEvolution Group\\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \\u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \\u201cEcological Genetics Group.\\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \\u201chatching\\u201d the \\u201cEGG\\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).</p>\\n<h2>4.4. Diversification</h2>\\n<p>Whereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \\u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>The earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \\u201ctotally out of the blue\\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic <em>Trifolium</em> was part of Bradshaw\\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. </p>\\n<p>Jones\\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \\u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.</p>\\n<p>The EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \\u201chome\\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.</p>\\n<p>Interest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of <em>Viola</em>, and later <em>Primula</em>. Although Valentine\\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \\u201870s, and \\u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.</p>\\n<p>Bradshaw\\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.</p>\\n<p>Since 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \\u201cSpecial Interest Group\\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.</p>\\n<h2>4.5. Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>One of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \\u201cancestry\\u201d\\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \\u201cgeneration\\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \\u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.</p>\\n<p>The brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.</p>\", \"about\": [1, 11, 13, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 30], \"tags\": [5]}}]",

It was genecological research that demonstrated just how powerful natural selection could be on small spatial scales, and just how quickly populations of plants could evolve as a result. The Genecology Project takes off from Bradshaw's story to tell the broader story of plant genecology and ecological genetics in Britain.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges of planning and articulating an historical research project is finding something to follow around; a narrative through-thread that can provide a coherent point of reference and a comparator for historical arguments. In my dissertation, that through-thread was Bradshaw and his intellectual trajectory: from his training at Cambridge and Aberystwyth, through the early development of his research program at Bangor and Liverpool. Following a field through time, however, is a much less straightforward task. What can appear from afar to be a coherent and well-defined system of people and research questions can quickly become murky and mercurial upon closer inspection. At the edges, the research aims and participants of a scientific field are constantly intermingling with those of other fields. Thus historians usually opt for easier targets: people, institutions, and sometimes scientific journals. Following these objects through time and space is indeed valuable, and a large part of the Genecology Project has been documenting the people, places, and productions of genecology and ecological genetics. But these paths are only tangential to the broader arc of history that we are attempting to follow: the growth and development of a scientific field. Some of those paths (Bradshaw's, for instance) track more closely to that arc than others.\r\n\r\nFortuitously, when it comes to the story of ecological genetics we have an even more substantial thread to follow: a community of scientists called the **Ecological Genetics Group (the EGG)**. The EGG is the longest-running professional meeting for ecological geneticists in Britain, and will [convene for the 60th time](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/events/egg2016/) in Aberystwyth, this spring. The connection between ecological genetics and the EGG goes far deeper than its name. It was Bradshaw and his colleagues in Wales and Scotland\u2014the genecologists\u2014whose informal meetings at Aberystwyth, Bangor, and Edinburgh in the mid-1950s gave rise to the EGG. It was through the students, colleagues, and acquaintances of that small nucleus of genecologists that the EGG expanded in subsequent decades. And, as the announcement for the 60th meeting makes clear, the EGG continues to consider Aberystwyth its \"home\". Thanks to the diligent work of EGG secretary [John Warren](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/staff/jhw/), the programs and attendance lists for almost every meeting has been deposited at the National Library of Wales. As through-threads go, this collections of names, institutions, and frequently titles and/or abstracts of presentations and discussion topics, provides a remarkable trail to follow from the middle of the 1950s up through 2016.\r\n\r\n## The Project\r\n\r\nOver the next several months, I will be tracing the EGG from its earliest meetings in the 1950s up through its 60th meeting in 2016. Unlike typical historical research projects, I won't be shutting myself up in a library for five years before emerging with an embossed door-stop: this project will take place out in the open\u2014\"in the wild\"\u2013on this website. I will begin with several posts from the final chapter of my dissertation, \"Hatching the EGG,\" adapted for online bite-sized consumption. I will then begin to reconstruct the investigative pathways of EGG participants, the individual threads of the EGG's development. As I attempt to understand the research questions and problems that characterized ecological genetics over this sixty-year period, I will also pay close attention to the institutional and geographic contexts in which that research took place, and the organisms that ecological geneticists studied. Rather than ruminate on this work in hope of producing a fully-formed synthesis, I will be posting my notes and reflections here as the project unfolds. Meanwhile, I'll be making available a variety of materials from my dissertation research, including recordings and transcripts of oral history interviews, photographs, and other \"digital surrogates\" that shed light on the history of ecological genetics.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I'll be making available a very rich dataset produced by researchers in the [Digital Innovation Group](http://diging.asu.edu) at Arizona State University that documents collaborative ties among genecologists in Britain around the middle of the 20th century.

The Genecology Project takes off from Bradshaw's story to tell the broader story of plant genecology and ecological genetics in Britain.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges of planning and articulating an historical research project is finding something to follow around; a narrative through-thread that can provide a coherent point of reference and a comparator for historical arguments. In my dissertation, that through-thread was Bradshaw and his intellectual trajectory: from his training at Cambridge and Aberystwyth, through the early development of his research program at Bangor and Liverpool. Following a field through time, however, is a much less straightforward task. What can appear from afar to be a coherent and well-defined system of people and research questions can quickly become murky and mercurial upon closer inspection. At the edges, the research aims and participants of a scientific field are constantly intermingling with those of other fields. Thus historians usually opt for easier targets: people, institutions, and sometimes scientific journals. Following these objects through time and space is indeed valuable, and a large part of the Genecology Project has been documenting the people, places, and productions of genecology and ecological genetics. But these paths are only tangential to the broader arc of history that we are attempting to follow: the growth and development of a scientific field. Some of those paths (Bradshaw's, for instance) track more closely to that arc than others.</p>\n<p>Fortuitously, when it comes to the story of ecological genetics we have an even more substantial thread to follow: a community of scientists called the <strong>Ecological Genetics Group (the EGG)</strong>. The EGG is the longest-running professional meeting for ecological geneticists in Britain, and will <a href=\"http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/events/egg2016/\">convene for the 60th time</a> in Aberystwyth, this spring. The connection between ecological genetics and the EGG goes far deeper than its name. It was Bradshaw and his colleagues in Wales and Scotland\u2014the genecologists\u2014whose informal meetings at Aberystwyth, Bangor, and Edinburgh in the mid-1950s gave rise to the EGG. It was through the students, colleagues, and acquaintances of that small nucleus of genecologists that the EGG expanded in subsequent decades. And, as the announcement for the 60th meeting makes clear, the EGG continues to consider Aberystwyth its \"home\". Thanks to the diligent work of EGG secretary <a href=\"https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/staff/jhw/\">John Warren</a>, the programs and attendance lists for almost every meeting has been deposited at the National Library of Wales. As through-threads go, this collections of names, institutions, and frequently titles and/or abstracts of presentations and discussion topics, provides a remarkable trail to follow from the middle of the 1950s up through 2016.</p>\n<h2>The Project</h2>\n<p>Over the next several months, I will be tracing the EGG from its earliest meetings in the 1950s up through its 60th meeting in 2016. Unlike typical historical research projects, I won't be shutting myself up in a library for five years before emerging with an embossed door-stop: this project will take place out in the open\u2014\"in the wild\"\u2013on this website. I will begin with several posts from the final chapter of my dissertation, \"Hatching the EGG,\" adapted for online bite-sized consumption. I will then begin to reconstruct the investigative pathways of EGG participants, the individual threads of the EGG's development. As I attempt to understand the research questions and problems that characterized ecological genetics over this sixty-year period, I will also pay close attention to the institutional and geographic contexts in which that research took place, and the organisms that ecological geneticists studied. Rather than ruminate on this work in hope of producing a fully-formed synthesis, I will be posting my notes and reflections here as the project unfolds. Meanwhile, I'll be making available a variety of materials from my dissertation research, including recordings and transcripts of oral history interviews, photographs, and other \"digital surrogates\" that shed light on the history of ecological genetics.</p>\n<p>In addition, I'll be making available a very rich dataset produced by researchers in the <a href=\"http://diging.asu.edu\">Digital Innovation Group</a> at Arizona State University that documents collaborative ties among genecologists in Britain around the middle of the 20th century.

        "body": "The following account of the formation of the Ecological Genetics Group is taken from chapter 4 of [my dissertation](https://www.academia.edu/12338967/Evolution_Under_Our_Feet_Anthony_David_Bradshaw_1926_2008_and_the_Rise_of_Ecological_Genetics). It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.\r\n\r\n## 4.2 Conception\r\n\r\nThe 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the [National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)](/concepts/10/) was to be held in July, 1956. [E. T. Jones](/concepts/people/8/) was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \u201cPowys\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the [WPBS](/concepts/11/) to NIAB. For members of the [SPBS](/concepts/12/), the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, [David Harberd](/concepts/people/9/), recalled, \u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  \r\n\r\nAs the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\u2019s wife, [Muriel](/concepts/people/13/), had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached [Gregor](/concepts/people/6/) and asked to be excused from the meeting. \u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\u201d Harberd explained, \u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. \r\n\r\nSuspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\u201d Gregor asked. \u201cOf course I want to go,\u201d Harberd replied, \u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\u201d Harberd replied:  \r\n\r\n> Well, it's just social. There\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) \r\n\r\nSo upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\u2019s idea to [Keith Jones](/concepts/people/14/),  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in *Agrostis*, for one of his own staff members, [Dennis Wilkins](/people/16/), had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of [Bradshaw\u2019s](/concepts/people/1/) 1952 discovery at [Goginan mine](/concepts/15/). Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. \r\n\r\nGregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:\r\n\r\n> When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\u201d , \u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). \r\n\r\nGregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,\r\n\r\n> I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of *Agrostis* under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). \r\n\r\nUpon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:\r\n\r\n> I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).\r\n \r\nSo Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \u201cOregon\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of *Drosophila melanogaster*,\r\n\r\n> Oh, Oregon. That\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)\r\n \r\nThe visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:\r\n\r\n> We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)\r\n\r\nA third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\r\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.\r\n\r\n> We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). \r\n\r\nGregor also described the meeting as \u201cinformal\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\u2019s\r\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. \r\n\r\n> Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite>\r\n\r\nThe fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\r\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.\r\n\r\n## 4.3. Incorporation\r\nThomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\r\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \u201cenvironmental education\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of *Euphorbia cyparissias* (cypress spurge) and *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nIn his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \u201cthe country\u2019s gene pools.\u201d He wrote:\r\n\r\n> A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite>\r\n\r\nGregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. \r\n\r\n> I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite>\r\n\r\nIn the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.\r\n\r\nFrom Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled *The conservation of ecological races*, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:\r\n\r\n> The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\r\n\r\nBradshaw\u2019s work on *Agrostis* at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. \r\n\r\n> As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\r\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme *Agrostis stolonifera* x *A. tenuis* hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\r\n\r\nIn his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\r\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. \r\n\r\n> A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\r\n\r\nThe group seemed to agree that \u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\u201d as well as to provide \u201cuseful sources of genes\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: \r\n\r\n> It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\r\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite>\r\n\r\nFinally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \u201cGenecology Group\u201d was rejected, and \u201cEvolution Group\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \u201cEcological Genetics Group.\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \u201chatching\u201d the \u201cEGG\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).\r\n\r\n## 4.4. Diversification\r\nWhereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \u201ctotally out of the blue\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic *Trifolium* was part of Bradshaw\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. \r\n\r\nJones\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.\r\n\r\nThe EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\r\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \u201chome\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.\r\n\r\nInterest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of *Viola*, and later *Primula*. Although Valentine\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.\r\n\r\nBradshaw\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \u201870s, and \u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.\r\n\r\nBradshaw\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.\r\n\r\nSince 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \u201cSpecial Interest Group\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.\r\n\r\n## 4.5. Conclusion\r\nOne of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \u201cancestry\u201d\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \u201cgeneration\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.",

It has been slightly tweaked for the web, and there may be some artifacts and typos from the conversion process. Over the next few weeks I'll revise this post with additional annotations, links, and other elaborations.</p>\n<h2>4.2 Conception</h2>\n<p>The 1956 meeting of the Fellows of the <a href=\"/concepts/10/\">National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)</a> was to be held in July, 1956. <a href=\"/concepts/people/8/\">E. T. Jones</a> was to receive the NIAB Cereal Award for his \u201cPowys\u201d variety of winter oats, and to confer with NIAB leadership about the ongoing transfer of grass and clover seed stocks from the <a href=\"/concepts/11/\">WPBS</a> to NIAB. For members of the <a href=\"/concepts/12/\">SPBS</a>, the annual NIAB meeting was seen as an obligation. \u201cAll the plant breeding stations had to get together each year,\u201d one of the Genecology Section staff, <a href=\"/concepts/people/9/\">David Harberd</a>, recalled, \u201cand you didn't have any choice in the matter: you went. The bosses in London just decided where you were meeting and you went\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.).  </p>\n<p>As the NIAB meeting approached, however, circumstances were extraordinarily complicated for Harberd. Harberd\u2019s wife, <a href=\"/concepts/people/13/\">Muriel</a>, had dropped six stone (over 80 pounds) due to complications with her pregnancy, and was still recovering as the NIAB meeting approached. So several days before the trip to Cambridge, Harberd approached <a href=\"/concepts/people/6/\">Gregor</a> and asked to be excused from the meeting. \u201cI cannot leave Muriel just now,\u201d Harberd explained, \u201cShe's gone through such a hell of a time, and I must be here for her.\u201d Gregor assured Harberd that he would sort things out so that he could be excused. </p>\n<p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, however, he probed Harberd further. \u201cI don't think you want  to go, do you?\u201d Gregor asked. \u201cOf course I want to go,\u201d Harberd replied, \u201cIt's jolly good, but I just don't want to be away from home.\u201d After all, he had lived in Cambridge for several years prior to moving to Edinburgh, and many of his friends remained in the area. Gregor pushed further: \u201cWell now, what benefits do you think you get from these [meetings]?\u201d Harberd replied:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, it's just social. There\u2019s nobody there will be working on grasses. Last time when  we were all over in Belfast, we had to go through flax breeding. Well there wasn't a single person there who knew anything about flax breeding apart from these folk.  And it was fascinating to learn their problems and how they were tackling them, but  we couldn't contribute. Really, it just so happened that it was fascinating, but if we're going to have a session on breeding watercress or something, I can't imagine how we're going to -- I mean it\u2019s is a different kettle of fish altogether. I really think the money would be much better spent if, instead of the whole station decamping like that, we had an arrangement whereby all the potato breeders could gather together every so often and exchange gossips. And the barley breeders could do this, and all the grass breeders could do this. It would be cheaper, and it would be far more efficient, and we'd really make some progress. (Harberd pers. comm.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So upon arriving at Cambridge, Gregor mentioned Harberd\u2019s idea to <a href=\"/concepts/people/14/\">Keith Jones</a>,  who had accompanied E. T. Jones from the WPBS. Jones was quite interested in a meeting specifically focused on grasses and grass breeding. Gregor was also fascinated to hear of Bradshaw\u2019s ongoing work on lead tolerance in <em>Agrostis</em>, for one of his own staff members, <a href=\"/people/16/\">Dennis Wilkins</a>, had undertaken similar studies on mine tips in Lanarkshire after reading of <a href=\"/concepts/people/1/\">Bradshaw\u2019s</a> 1952 discovery at <a href=\"/concepts/15/\">Goginan mine</a>. Jones and Gregor agreed to convene a meeting that would bring the staffs of their two departments together and provide an opportunity for Bradshaw and Wilkins to compare notes. </p>\n<p>Gregor wrote to Jones around a month later to firm up their plans. Gregor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we met at Cambridge I told you of the wish of our genecological group to pay Aberystwyth a  visit some time this autumn,\u201d , \u201cto see the work you and your colleages are doing with the wild grasses, and you very kindly agreed to have us. [\u2026] You will remember that the suggestion was to get Bradshaw down to Aberystwyth at the same time so that we might hear about his latest work on Agrostis , and particularly to give Wilkins an opportunity to discuss with him the lead tip flora and, if possible, to visit some of the tips in his company  (D1041/2/9/22/2). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gregor proposed a meeting on a Wednesday, the 26th of September, with a field trip to the mine tips on Thursday. Jones passed the letter on to Bradshaw, writing,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had some prolonged discussions with him at Cambridge some time ago and he is very keen to visit us. He would particularly like you to be here if you can manage it both to hear of your gene-ecological stuff and for you to take Wilkins to the lead mine areas.  Watson has some interesting information on hybridisation of <em>Agrostis</em> under natural conditions, and I have no doubt that we should profit by discussions with them (D1041/2/9/22). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Upon hearing back from Bradshaw, Jones replied to Gregor enthusiastically, writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had not forgotten about your desire to visit the W.P.B.S., and indeed we shall be looking forward to seeing you and your part. For the past month I have been trying to get in touch with the elusive Bradshaw, and at last today I received a letter from him from Fort William, where is is on holiday. As far as I can make out he will be able to come here on the 26th September. This date is also suitable for [Martin] Borrill and myself, although Mr. [Arthur R.] Beddows will probably not be here. (NLW ex 2747).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Gregor, Harberd, Wilkins, and Patricia Watson traveled to Aberystwyth. Gregor and Wilkins passed the time by playing chess in their booth. Bradshaw came down from Bangor on his green motorbike with David Jowett, who had recently arrived from Liverpool, riding on the back. The Edinburgh party arrived at the Aberystwyth train platform in torrential rain. In 1955 the WPBS had moved its operations from its hillside campus at Penglais to a site further east at Plas Gogerddan, so none of the visitors knew which bus to catch. After asking around for directions, navigating buses, and walking in the rain, they eventually arrived at the white mansion at Plas Gogderddan that housed the new administrative offices of the WPBS. They spent the day exchanging notes, catching each other up on their latest research. That night, Harberd and Bradshaw stayed with Keith Jones at his on-campus house, named \u201cOregon\u201d; when they arrived for dinner that evening, Bradshaw quipped jokingly, referring to the Oregon-R strain of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh, Oregon. That\u2019s a place for a wild type to live! (Harberd pers. comm.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The visit was deemed a success, and promises were made to reconvene the following year. In April of 1957, Pat Watson wrote to Keith Jones inviting the WPBS contingent to  visit Edinburgh late that summer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We hope that you and some of your colleagues will be able to come visit us this year, and that the meeting will prove to be as interesting as we found our visit to Aberystwyth last September. As always happens, the summer months promise to be very busy but since we understand that some of you might be interested in the Edinburgh Festival also, I am writing to propose a two-day visit sometime between 15th and 20th August. (NLW ex 2747)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A third meeting was held at Bangor the following year, this time in late March or\nearly April. Bradshaw sent the invitation for a fourth meeting to Gregor on 17 January, 1959.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We would be very pleased indeed if we could hold another of our informal discussions this Easter. We would all be very delighted to see you down here. ... Keith Jones is in Canada so we would not have him with us, but we would hope to have at least Borrill from the P.B.S (GD449/16/6). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gregor also described the meeting as \u201cinformal\u201d in his reply. Bradshaw\u2019s\nwork on lead tolerance in Agrostis also remained a dominant part of the discussion. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many thanks for your letter inviting our herbage group to informal discussions at Bangor, an invitation we gladly accept. As to the date of the meeting, Wednesday, March 25th would suit us very well and I take it that day would also suit you. Wilkins, however, feels he would like an extra day to see your people about his lead resistance work. He therefore proposed travelling on Monday 23rd and spending the following day discussing the lead programme. <cite>(GD449/16/4)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fifth meeting, in 1960, had a substantially different flavor from those that\npreceded it. Participation in the group increase substantially, and it was at this meeting that the group adopted the name Ecological Genetics Group and began to establish a somewhat more formal structure. In the next section, I briefly describe the content and focus of that meeting.</p>\n<h2>4.3. Incorporation</h2>\n<p>Thomas Owen Pirtchard (b. 13 May, 1932) was a graduate of the Agricultural Zoology\nProgram at Bangor, and shortly after finishing his undergraduate degree went to work as Deputy Director of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. The Nature Conservancy was established in 1949 with an explicit mandate of translating ecological research into public policy for the protection of natural resources (Goodson 1993). Pritchard is credited with the origination of the phrase \u201cenvironmental education\u201d at the 1948 conference of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Disinger 1984). Pritchard advocated environmental education as both vocational training for resource managers and as way to create \u201cpublic awareness about environmental affairs, with the ultimate aim of realising the conservation of natural resources and stimulating enjoyment of the environment\u201d (IUCN 1972, p. 1). Pritchard had worked with Bradshaw in the mid-1950s on the genecology of Trifolium repens in Snowdonia, and went on to receive a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of Leeds for his work on the genecology of <em>Euphorbia cyparissias</em> (cypress spurge) and <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (St. John\u2019s wort). It is through this association that Pritchard became acquainted with what was becoming a regular Easter meeting of genecologists from Edinburgh, Aberystwyth, and Bangor, and during discussions with Bradshaw became excited about the prospect of hosting such a meeting at the Nature Conservancy office at Attingham Park, just east of Shrewsbury.</p>\n<p>In his invitation to Gregor in March, 1960, Pritchard was candid about his desire to address conservation issues at the meeting. Specifically, Pritchard was interested in the conserving \u201cthe country\u2019s gene pools.\u201d He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A few days ago, I discussed with Dr. Bradshaw of Bangor arrangements for holding a meeting of people interested in evolution in natural populations. [\u2026] The meeting will be informal as usual and attended by about 20 people actively engaged in research on plant populations. It is expected that one or two short papers will be given to introduce topics for discussion and we would also like the group to give some time to discuss the conservation of the country\u2019s gene pools, particularly old pastures and other areas from which breeding material has been obtained in the past. <cite>(GD449/24)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gregor expressed some trepidation about the anticipated size of the meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I hope that the meeting will be able to retain its thoroughly informal character, for it seems to us that with twenty people it shows signs of becoming just one more conference. <cite>JW Gregor (GD449/24)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the end fifteen people, including Pritchard, arrived for the meeting on Monday, the 25th of April. Harberd was involved in an automobile accident prior to the meeting and was unable to attend. Gregor also missed the meeting, but the SPBS was represented by genecologist Frederick England.</p>\n<p>From Bangor, Bradshaw brought his students John Aston and Roy Snaydon. The largest contingent came from the WPBS, including Les Breese, Malcolm Calder, John Cooper, Keith Jones, and Martin Borrill. Some new faces included Michael Harvey, a first-year Ph.D. student at Durham, Audrey Plack from Keele, Miss K. Luck from Cambridge, and Nature Conservancy staffer Miss E. Copeland Watts. Jones, Borrill, and Pritchard presented papers on Monday afternoon, and Goodway, Snaydon, Bradshaw and Cooper presented their recent work the following day. (GD449/25)</p>\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Pritchard turned the conservation away from research updates and toward \u201cthe conservation of ecological races and subspecies.\u201d One of the central themes of that conversation was the idea that the locally adapted plant populations, heretofore exploited by plant breeders, were a valuable natural resource and thus an important object of conservation. Pritchard drew together his notes from that conversation to write a short paper titled <em>The conservation of ecological races</em>, which was circulated internally at the Nature Conservancy. Pritchard wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The great variety of distinct natural and manmade habitats occurring in the British Isles has been conducive to widespread differentiation of ecologic races in plant species. In this country, races differentiated in response to longestablished agricultural and forestry management systems are, to the student of evolution, at least of equal significance as those races adapted to natural habitats which are relatively extreme in terms of edaphic and climatic conditions such as in the higher mountains and along the coastline. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bradshaw\u2019s work on <em>Agrostis</em> at Port Meadow in Oxford was cited in the discussion. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As an example, Port Meadow in Oxford \u2026 has been recorded as common land belonging to the Burghers of Oxford since Domesday times and, fortunately, it still exists as a habitat where grazing pressure as a selection force has been operative for centuries. The races of grasses and other species occurring there are of special\ninterest to the research worker and plant breeder. Extreme <em>Agrostis stolonifera</em> x <em>A. tenuis</em> hybrids, for example, exist there and further study will inevitably reveal the presence of other interesting types. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his write-up, Pritchard warned about the dangers of losing habitats like Port\nMeadow, and the plant populations therein. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A habitat such as Port Meadow is extremely vulnerable in our time. Discounting complete destruction by ploughing or building development, it can be easily lost through simple changes in management methods. The older grazing systems are rapidly vanishing, the result being degeneration of old pasture communities and disappearance of the ecological races in them. Port Meadow still exists but there are rumours that it was recently sprayed with a chemical weedkiller to control ragwort; obviously, such a practice is bound to have devastating effects on its plant populations. <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The group seemed to agree that \u201ccertain ecotypes and subspecies\u201d ought to be conserved both for their value to investigations of \u201cexperimental taxonomy and evolution\u201d as well as to provide \u201cuseful sources of genes\u201d for agriculturally valuable characters. Pritchard wrote: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the most urgent task at this stage is to document information on the best localities, and to take appropriate action after this has been considered. Members of the Ecological Genetics Group would be willing to co-operate in such a\nscheme.  <cite>(GD449/25)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the group took up the issue of establishing a more formal structure. They agreed to meet annually, to limit the size of the meeting to \u201cabout 15 to 25 persons engaged in experimental studies on populations,\u201d and that the organizers should keep minutes from each meeting. Several names were considered: \u201cGenecology Group\u201d was rejected, and \u201cEvolution Group\u201d was also deemed unfavorable \u201cunless the word Experimental was included.\u201d Ultimately, they adopted the name \u201cEcological Genetics Group.\u201d Harberd suspected later that Keith Jones might have advocated for the name, partly due to the humor of \u201chatching\u201d the \u201cEGG\u201d around Easter time (Harberd pers. comm.).</p>\n<h2>4.4. Diversification</h2>\n<p>Whereas the 1960 meeting established the identity and purpose of the EGG, the 1961 meeting moved the EGG into a broader institutional arena. Keith Jones, who had recently left the WPBS to work at the Jodrell Laboratory at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, hosted the meeting. Bringing the EGG into southern England drew in a much broader array of participants. Harberd, who had recovered from his automobile accident, remembered the gathering as \u201cone of our most flourishing meetings. That was when we first became not a tight little group, but much wider\u201d (Harberd pers. comm.). In addition to new faces from the research team at Kew, many others attended from the larger Universities in southern England. The well-known American botanist George Ledyard Stebbins, from California, was visiting the UK at the time and made an appearance, along with E. J. H. Corner from Cambridge.</p>\n<p>The earliest connections to the animal genetics community at Oxford came in 1961, albeit by way of a botanist. David A. Jones was in the second year of his Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology at Oxford. His invitation to the EGG meeting came \u201ctotally out of the blue\u201d (Jones pers. comm.). Although Jones\u2019 earliest graduate research was in animal genetics, even involving Lepidoptera, by 1961 his interests had shifted to cyanogenesis and lectins in plants. Cyanogeneic <em>Trifolium</em> was part of Bradshaw\u2019s teaching portfolio in genetics in the 1950s, and it is possible that this shared interest, along with Jones\u2019 general interest in polymorphism and ecological genetics, were what resulted in the invitation. </p>\n<p>Jones\u2019 continued involvement in the EGG opened the door to others from the zoology and animal genetics community at Oxford in subsequent years. For example, David William Snow, an ornithologist (Ph.D. Oxford, 1953), first attended the EGG in 1965. Entomologist John R. G. Turner (Ph.D. Oxford, 1969, Lepidoptera), and zoologist Bryan Clarke (Ph.D. Oxford, 1962, Cepaea) attended in 1966. Shortly after attending the EGG Clarke went on to organize the animal-oriented \u201cPopulation Genetics Group,\u201d now known as PGG or PopGroup, modeled on the EGG meetings. Meanwhile, after finishing his Ph.D. in 1961, David Jones was hired as Assistant Lecturer at Birmingham. Dennis Wilkins joined the staff at Birmingham shortly therafter. This drew in more non-plant biologists from Birmingham, including Michael J. Lawrence (Ph.D. Aberystwyth, 1958, Drosophila) in 1965, and Michael J. Kearsay (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1965, Drosophila) and Giora Simchen (Ph.D. Birmingham, 1966, yeast) in 1966.</p>\n<p>The EGG grew and diversified over the next several decades, drawing in participants\nfrom other research groups as well as providing a \u201chome\u201d for the students of its central participants. Despite Gregor\u2019s concerns about the growth of their informal annual meeting, except on rare occasions the overall attendance remained at around thirty well into the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Interest from David Henriques Valentine (1912\u20131987) in 1964 brought in a new crop of genecologists from the University of Durham, where Valentine was then Professor of Botany. Valentine became involved in genecological research in the 1940s, and most of his work focused on species of <em>Viola</em>, and later <em>Primula</em>. Although Valentine\u2019s genecology retained much of the taxonomic hue that the Gregorian school had cast aside, his interest in abrupt versus gradual speciation was a point of intellectual overlap with Bradshaw and his colleagues. Like Gregor, Valentine was also interested in the problem of professionalization and institutionalization for genecology. Several of Valentine\u2019s students, as well as his colleague Jack Crosby, were invited to the 1964 meeting and became regular EGG attendees.</p>\n<p>Bradshaw\u2019s students at Bangor made up a large part of the new recruits in the 1960s, \u201870s, and \u201880s. John Aston, Janis Antonovics, Glenys Crossley, Peter Gregory, Thomas McNeilly, and John Pusey all attended in 1964. As students from Bangor, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh took posts at other British universities they not only continued to attend EGG meetings but also brought along their students and colleagues. For example, Antonovics worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling between 1966 and 1970, and brought along several of his students, including Henry Ford, Heather Dickinson, and Joseph Watson. Roy Snaydon, who went on to work at the University of Reading and further developed the work on mineral nutrition, drew in a steady stream of students as well.</p>\n<p>Bradshaw\u2019s move to Liverpool in 1968 substantially broadened the base of attendees, as his students and colleagues joined the group. Staff and students from Aberystwyth, the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Scottish Plant Breeding Station (later Scottish Crop Research Institute), and other agricultural research centers and provincial colleges continued to make up a large proportion of the overall attendance well into the 1990s. Over time, the EGG also attracted visitors from the European continent and North America. Bernard Dommee, who studied intraspecific variation in reproduction in Calluna vulgaris, was responsible for bringing in French students from Montpellier, starting in the late 1970s. Pieter Kakes, a genecologist at the University of Amsterdam, attended the meetings between 1975 and 1991, and brought along several Dutch botany students during that period.</p>\n<p>Since 1988 the EGG has been recognized as a \u201cSpecial Interest Group\u201d of the British Ecological Society. The EGG has continued to hold its Easter-time meeting, the last of which was held 30 March through 1 April 2015, at Edge Hill University in Liverpool.</p>\n<h2>4.5. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>One of the most striking features of the Ecological Genetics Group over the past sixty years has been its continuity with the original community of agricultural genecologists in Scotland and Wales that began meeting informally in 1956. A preliminary analysis indicates that a very large proportion of attendees over the past several years can trace their scientific \u201cancestry\u201d\u2014in terms of supervisor-student relationships\u2014to either the early cohorts of attendees in the 1950s and 1960s. Most recent participants have been in the third or fourth \u201cgeneration\u201d of scientists since the group began meeting in 1956. The EGG thus provides a clear continuity from the Gregorian genecology of the 1930s and \u201840s to contemporary ecological genetics in Britain.</p>\n<p>The brief history of the Ecological Genetics Group offered in this chapter is a starting-point for further investigations into the evolution of British ecological genetics and evolutionary population ecology. While this account has highlighted key turning points and some qualitative trends, it leaves an open field for investigating the changing contexts, concepts, and content of ecological genetics in Britain in subsequent decades. The attendance records housed at the National Library of Wales are impressively comprehensive, and present a unique and attractive opportunity to reconstruct the history of ecological genetics in even greater detail. But with such an opportunity comes many challenges, the most notable of which is the problem of scale. Although attendance at the EGG meetings only rarely exceeded 50 people, the cumulative number of attendees since 1956 exceeds one thousand individual scientists. Moreover, the volume of research literature produced by the average ecologist has increased substantially since the 1960s. An analysis that pays adequate attention to the conceptual, methodological, and contextual dimensions of the investigative activities in which those scientists were engaged requires tools and methodologies that can scale with the volume of materials on which it is deployed. To that end, I have begun to draw together techniques from computational linguistics and social network analysis that can be applied to the history of the EGG, and other similar associations.</p>",

        "description": "> Plant ecologist Anthony David Bradshaw's account of the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity remains central to contemporary research aimed at understanding how organisms persist in heterogeneous environments. Bradshaw suggested that changes in particular traits in response to specific environmental factors could be under direct genetic control, and that natural selection could therefore act directly to shape those responses: plasticity was not \"noise\" obscuring a genetic signal, but could be specific and refined just as any other adaptive phenotypic trait. In this paper, I document the contexts and development of Bradshaw's investigation of phenotypic plasticity in plants, including a series of unreported experiments in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Contrary to the mythology that later emerged around Bradshaw's ideas, Bradshaw was engaged in a serious and sustained empirical research program concerning plasticity in the 1950s and 1960s that went far beyond a single review paper. Moreover, that work was not isolated, but was surrounded by an already rich theoretical discourse and a substantial body of empirical research concerning the evolution of developmental plasticity and stability. Bradshaw recast the problem of how to understand (and control) plasticity and stability within an epistemic framework focused on genetic differences and natural selection.",

        "content": "Passage from Lily Newton (1944). E. A Lewis was likely the historian at Aberystwyth. Herbert Jones was a botanist at Aberystwyth.\r\n\r\n> Surveys of the plants growing on the old workings and dumps at Goginan made by E. A. Lewis & Herbert Jones (unpublished) demonstrated the paucity of species and individuals. Thlaspi alpestre was absent, though it occurred in the Ystwyth valley in polluted areas and was a conspicuous feature of the colonized old workings of the Mendip Hills.\r\n\r\n> Hooper & Newton (1935) and Hooper (1937) showed that lead had only a very slight toxic effect on dwarf French beans grown in single salt cultures with lead sulphate, or in the presence of nutrient salts and lead sulphate. This was true even when a saturated solution of lead sulphate was used, containing 30 p.p.m. lead. Spraying experiments indicated that the presence of lead on Ulex, Lupinus or Carter's '50 days' dwarf French bean plants had no deleterious effects. It was concluded that the presence of lead was not the direct cause of the barren nature of the mine dumps.\r\n\r\n> Newton et al. (1937) and Davies (1941) showed that zinc sulphate is toxic to plant growth, and that its presence on the mine dumps is one reason for the slight vegetation and the pollution of the rivers. The results suggested that phosphate deficiency might be a limiting factor, since any phosphates in the soil would combine readily with the zinc present and be unavailable for plant growth: liberal phosphate dressings on the mine dumps might therefore have a beneficial effect on the establishment of vegetation.\r\n\r\n> Newton & Glencross (1940) carried out two series of experiments: (a) water cultures to ascertain the combined effect of lead and zinc on dwarf beans; and (b) pot cultures to determine the effect of lead on beans and clover, grown in the presence of excess lime and phosphate. Series (a) gave results similar to those obtained for zinc alone, and further confirmed former observations of the liability of plants grown in the presence of zinc to fungal attack, and of the possibility of phosphate deficiency being one cause of the paucity of vegetation. In series (b) beans and clover were used as examples of plants comparatively resistant and resistive respectively to the presence of polluting metals. The presence of lead affected the germination of the seeds in both cases, but the experiments proved that the addition of excess calcium carbonate, and also of excess calcium carbonate and basic slag, materially reduced any deleterious effect of the lead on the subsequent growth of the plants.\r\n\r\n> Newton et al. (1938) continued this work, using zinc and also lead with zinc, but the results are not yet available. The preliminary results indicated that dressings of superphosphate and potassium sulphate were beneficial when added to the soil of the mine dumps, but that ammonium sulphate was markedly deleterious.\r\n\r\n> A survey by Jones & Lloyd (unpublished) of the flowering plants of the Rheidol and Melindwr in 1938-9 showed that in the lower reaches of the Rheidol vegetation was luxurious. They established that Ranunculus aquatics is very sensitive to polution, and that the plant ceases to occur where tributary streams bring polluted water into the main river.\r\n\r\n> The aggregate results of the experiments showed that, botanically, zinc is a more serious source of pollution than lead, and that phosphate deficiency is probably one of the causes of the poor development of vegetation of the dumps.\r\n\r\n> The presence of up to 1 p.p.m. of zinc was shown to stimulate the growth of dwarf French beans, but in the presence of 1-10 p.p.m. the toxicity increases sharply with concentration, the plants being stunted and liable to fungal attack, a fact noted in other plants growing on the dumps. There is also a definite indication of the value of the addition of lime and phosphate to the soil in attempting to grow plants in areas influenced by mine effluent.\r\n\r\n> Field experiments were conducted at Goginan, where it was established that one of the most serious causes of the small amount of vegetation is the blown material from the old slime pits, which is carried on the adjacent land. This is a serious and continuous menace, irrespective of whether mining is in progress. The leaching of lead and zinc from the surface material of old slime pits is a phenomenon which reduces the incidence of pollution so long as the mines are note working and the dumps are undisturbed, but time does not lessen the damage caused by blown material. Experiments conducted at Goginan showed that the material enveloped the vegetation in the vicinity, and in the case of young pine trees it kept pace with the annual growth so that only the uppermost whorl of branches was ever exposed. The treatment of the large surface of fine material which occupies the position of the old slim pits, by covering it with soil or spraying with some binding substance such as bitumen, would remove this source of polution. If the soil method were adopted colonization by vegetation would be possible, and the removal, at all events in part, of the unsightly character of the old mines would be effected.",
